    <p>Github has a lot of settings that you can change. You can change your username, email, and other settings. Whenever you checkpoint your changes, git will add some information about your such as your username and email to the commit. There is a git config file that stores all the settings that you have changed. You can make settings like what editor you would like to use etc. There are some global settings and some repository specific settings.</p>
